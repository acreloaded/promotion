The AssaultCube Reloaded (ACR) Promotion Server (ACP) runs on AssaultCube (AC), but attempts to promote ACR!

This package is for **server operators only**, to run a *promotion server* to convert AC players to ACR.

Download and play AssaultCube Reloaded: <https://code.google.com/p/assaultcuber/>

Server mods include:

 * Feel free to set maxclients to over 20, since it will still work!
 * Automatically adds ACR's name to the server description, so you don't have to
 * Promotes AssaultCube Reloaded every 5-15 seconds (owner-adjustable) via console spam
 * Server always green
 * Moon-jump
 * ACR-like damage fading (but will fade completely in contrast to ACR)
 * Friendly fire returns to user
 * Headshots for all weapons
 * ~~256 clients instead of 20~~ This will cause your server to be hidden
 * Spawn with a nade!
