# *ACR* Promotion Server
The `AssaultCube Reloaded (ACR) Promotion Server` (*ACP*) runs on `AssaultCube` (*AC*), but attempts to promote *ACR*!

This package is for **server operators only**, to run a **promotion server** to advertise *ACR* to *AC* players.

Download and play *AssaultCube Reloaded*: <http://acr.victorz.ca/>

## Server modifications include:

 * Feel free to set `-c maxclients` to 256, since it will still work!
 * Automatically **adds *ACR*'s name to the server description**, so you don't have to
 * Promotes *ACR* **every 5-15 seconds (owner-adjustable) via console spam**
 * Server is **always green**
 * **Moon-jump**: a server mod in *ACR* (if the server owner enables it)
 * **Explosive** ammo: another *ACR* server mod
 * **Damage fading** similar to *ACR* but unrefined
 * **Friendly fire returns** to sender (avoid teamkills)
 * **Headshots** for all weapons similar to *ACR*
 * ~~256 clients instead of 20~~ This will cause your server to be hidden
 * When spawning, randomly **start with grenades**!
