Packaging AssaultCube:

1. fresh svn checkout (Don't start AC afterwards to avoid any changes)
2. delete config/saved.cfg if existent
3. make sure config/servers.cfg is empty
4. delete contents of folder screenshots/
5. delete contents of folder demos/
6. delete the whole source/ folder
7. delete the whole docs/autogen/ folder
8. Copy shadow files (.dat) from another working AC installation (SVN) into the freshly exported directory
9. Delete the bin_*/ folders that are not needed by your platform
10.Package AC (.exe/.tgz/etc) and name it like AssaultCube_vMAJOR.MINOR.BUILD.REVISION.FORMAT on Windows this could be AssaultCube_v1.0.0.0.exe

This steps can be automatized, see source\vcpp\buildEnv\*.bat for examples.
