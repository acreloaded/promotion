This is here as a reminder for myself (RandumKiwi) of everything that must be 
done in a map when making it official, as I will often overlook one of them.


Some things to remember to do when adding maps to the official maps:
====================================================================

1) Fix-up mistakes in the map.
2) Remove all un-needed comments/spaces/breaks from cfg files.
3) Ensure mapmsg only contains "Map name by Map author" with no colourings.
4) Add to the map menu, and the CTF map menu if applicable.
5) Add to "securemaps.cfg".
6) Add authors (plus texture/skymap/model/etc authors) to the readme.
   Remember to do this in the menus.cfg "credits" too.
7) Add new textures/models/skymaps/etc to default_map_settings.cfg as comments.
   If you added a skymap, add it to the "test skymaps" menu also.
8) Add new mapmodels to the editing menu.
9) Update the maprot.
10) Create bot waypoints.
