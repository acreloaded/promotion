License
=======

The AssaultCube source code is mainly based on the cube game/engine and uses the 
same license (z-lib like). See README_CUBEENGINE.txt
In addition AssaultCube contains code from pCube (Cube pro mod) and Sauerbraten (Cube successor)
and other sources.

Cheat Protection
================

The cheat protection described in README_CUBEENGINE.txt is not used in AssaultCube. Binaries 
compiled from source are compatible with the official binaries. This means, the client can 
easily be hacked, on the other hand, you can compile AssaultCube for different platforms and 
fix bugs yourself.
You MUST NOT connect to servers that are not yours with a modified client that contains changes 
that were not made for platform-compatibility or to fix bugs. This would be cheating. Thank you 
for supporting fair play gaming.
